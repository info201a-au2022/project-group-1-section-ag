## Chart 1

## Chart 2
This is a boxplot distribution between different groups of certificate TV rating(parental guideline system) such as TV-14, TV G, and TV Ma compared to user score (IMDB rating. According to user ratings from IMDB it looks as TV-Y7(audience targeted under 7) shows have the highest IMDB ratings on average. This observation was a little suprising because you'd assume TV-Ma and TV-14 would be the most popular and thus have the highest ratings. Most of the average ratings and distributions are similar across the different certificates. This chart help us to see if they're any differences in quality of tv shows across different parental guideline systems. 

```{r}
rating_certificate
```

## Chart 3
This is a bar chart distribution that is able to compare the top ten movies as well as TV shows in the category of comedy/action and what their IMBD ratings are. Looking at the bar chart, we can conclude that the movie/show that had the highest IMBD rating is called Daredevil with a rating of 8.6. The lowest on this bar chart is called Money Heist as well as Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) with a rating of 8.2 We can conclude that looking at the data and the bar chart that their rating are very similar to each other. We can also see that the data distrubuted is not biased towards movies or shows that it's actually a mix of both.


## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
