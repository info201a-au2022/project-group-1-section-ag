# Netflix Shows Around the United States
#### Emily Ma, Ian Pascal, Alex Chiu
## Introduction
Every day, month, or year, there are newly released Netflix shows each day for people to view. With so many new shows that are released one after another, we are curious what some top shows are around the country. By finding data from each state about shows, we can track the most viewed shows around each state because we are interested in the top shows that vary across the country. We plan to find data on this information using the website kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?datasetId=434238

## Research Questions
* What is the most popular show in each state across the United States?
  * This is our main question that we wanted to research about and we were curious on how it is compared across the country.
* How do different shows across the five regions (Northeast, Southwest, West, Southeast, and Midwest) compare to each other? Are there similarities or differences?
  * Even though we can find what each states favorite show is, we are also curious how it is comparable to each region since there is different opinions in each region.
* Researching about the most watched Netflix show in state, about how many hours was viewed on that show?
  * We are also curious about how many hours is spent on each show, it can tell us how much a state likes that show compared to any other place/region.
