# Netflix Shows Around the United States
#### Emily Ma, Ian Pascal, Alex Chiu
## Introduction
Every day, month, or year, there are newly released Netflix shows each day for people to view. With so many new shows that are released one after another, we are curious what some top shows are around the country. By finding data from each state about shows, we can track the most viewed shows around each state because we are interested in the top shows that vary across the country. We plan to find data on this information using the website kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?datasetId=434238


## Problem Domains
Many people gain inspiration and learn from insightful shows such as ones on Netflix. Netflix is home to award winning shows that have influenced many audiences' values and insights of the world. Direct stakeholders of Neflix involve film production crews, cooporate employees, and software engineers who put to gether the streaming platform. Then, indirect stakeholders involve, the customers who buy a Netflix subscription, film critics, and the film industry. Something that both stakeholders value include entertainment and inspiration. Both stakeholders seek to gain entertainment from easily accessible films and shows. People also seek inspiration after watching these shows because an entertaining show can teach people new things about themselves or others. 

## Research Questions
* What is the most popular show in each state across the United States?
  * This is our main question that we wanted to research about and we were curious on how it is compared across the country.
* How do different shows across the five regions (Northeast, Southwest, West, Southeast, and Midwest) compare to each other? Are there similarities or differences?
  * Even though we can find what each states favorite show is, we are also curious how it is comparable to each region since there is different opinions in each region.
* Researching about the most watched Netflix show in state, about how many hours was viewed on that show?
  * We are also curious about how many hours is spent on each show, it can tell us how much a state likes that show compared to any other place/region.

## Dataset
We found this dataset on Kaggle and it displays all TV shows and Movies metadata on Netflix. There are 12 different columns on the data set and 8807 different unique values (rows). This dataset gives us the necessary information about where the majority of movies/shows are produced. We hope to hear from indirect stakeholders and what Netflix shows they prefer. We can find the demographics of the audiences using the TV rating column that displays what audience the movie is for. We can see if there is a director for multiple movies and shows on Netflix wrangling the Director column. We plan on using more data sets to do more visualizations such as finding popularity, audience scores, and regional data on Netflix. This dataset gives us the foundation of all the current shows on the streaming service. Shivam Bandai created this dataset
